# Your one stop shop for Prettier and Eslint settings

Tired of headaches, of losing sleep worrying about your formatting and linting
rules? Well, take a load off friend, I have your solution right here. Just paste
this line in the ole terminal over there,

```
  npm i -D https://github.com/colonyamerican/eslint-prettier-plugin
```

make sure there is a .eslintrc file in the root of your project with this one
single line,

```
{
  extends: "eslint-prettier-plugin"
}
```

and you're sitting on easy street.
